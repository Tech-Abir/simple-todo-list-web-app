    <h1>Hello (fallback)</h1>
    <p>This app was generated as a fallback because AI Pipe failed. Brief: Upgrade the To-Do List web page to include JavaScript functionality. Users should be able to add tasks dynamically when clicking the Add button, and also clear all tasks with a Clear All button. No backend required.</p>
